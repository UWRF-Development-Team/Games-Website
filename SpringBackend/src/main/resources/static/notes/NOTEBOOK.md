 - What is not working?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Start button is not responsive. Piece images are not responsive.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 - What is the expected behavior?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Start button should reset the board. Pieces should respond to click and
    reveal the piece image or waits until a free space is clicked.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 - What can you do to try to fix it?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Isolate the problem. Remove any unnessary contamination. Restructure the
    relationships of the base components and the UI components. If there are
    issues with requests, investigate other sources to see if the problem is
    is inherent to the code or another issue altogether. Isolate chains of
    events to try and find the solution to one problem insead of flooding the
    code with data before being able to implement the data.
